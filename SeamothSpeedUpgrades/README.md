## Features

The modules are unlocked along with the SeaMoth, can be fabricated in the [Moonpool Vehicle Upgrade Console](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Upgrade_Console_(Subnautica))

Although the most logical decision would be to fabricate all the modules in the vehicle console of the Moonpool,
I have done it this way to have early access to the first speed increase :)

Each module increases the speed and the power consumption.

### SeaMothSpeedModuleMKI

Increases speed by 100% and the power consumption by 25%, you will go 2 times faster than vanilla.
